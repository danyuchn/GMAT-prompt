## How to Use
- Each file includes "Instruction," "Function," "Suitable For," and "Example."  
- Start by checking "Suitable For" to see if it matches your needs, then review "Function" for confirmation.  
- Apply these prompts to your preferred LLM model. For example, with ChatGPT: use `o4-mini` for math-related content, `o3` or `o4-mini-high` for graph-related content, and prioritize `o4-mini-high` > `o3` > `4o` for verbal-related content.
