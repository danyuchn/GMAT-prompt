### Detailed Explanation of Each Answer Choice:

---

#### **(A)**  
- **First**: _‚ÄúDescribes a circumstance that is addressed by the policy response‚Äù_  
  ‚Üí This is a **situation** or **problem** that the argument uses as **justification for proposing a policy**.  
  ‚Üí E.g., "Air pollution levels have risen sharply" justifies a proposed emissions policy.  
- **Second**: _‚ÄúProvides evidence to support the main conclusion‚Äù_  
  ‚Üí This is a **supporting premise** that backs up the central claim.  
  ‚Üí Could be statistical or empirical data that reinforces the conclusion.

---

#### **(B)**  
- **First**: _Same as A_ ‚Üí a **circumstance addressed by the policy response**.  
  ‚Üí So it‚Äôs still the problem the policy intends to solve.  
- **Second**: _‚ÄúEvidence that has been used to argue that no coherent policy can be formulated‚Äù_  
  ‚Üí This is a **counterpoint**, or prior reasoning **against** the policy‚Äôs feasibility.  
  ‚Üí Suggests the second statement is part of a **counter-argument**, not supporting the conclusion.

---

#### **(C)**  
- **First**: _‚ÄúProvides evidence to support the main conclusion‚Äù_  
  ‚Üí Standard **supporting premise** again.  
- **Second**: _‚ÄúA claim that the argument acknowledges as an unanswered objection‚Äù_  
  ‚Üí The argument **mentions** a potential weakness or challenge, but does **not refute** it.  
  ‚Üí This functions as a **concession** without resolution, possibly weakening the conclusion.

---

#### **(D)**  
- **First**: _Same as C_ ‚Üí evidence supporting the main conclusion.  
- **Second**: _‚ÄúA consideration used to argue that there might never be more evidence than is already available‚Äù_  
  ‚Üí This is a **meta-level** claim: a reason to **doubt that better evidence will emerge**.  
  ‚Üí Could be used to **solidify reliance on current evidence**, or suggest **epistemic limitations**.

---

#### **(E)**  
- **First**: _‚ÄúAn objection that has been raised against a policy defended in the argument‚Äù_  
  ‚Üí A **challenge** or **criticism** targeting the policy itself (not necessarily the conclusion).  
  ‚Üí Could involve unintended consequences, practicality, fairness, etc.  
- **Second**: _‚ÄúProvides evidence to support the main conclusion‚Äù_  
  ‚Üí Standard **supporting premise** for the main conclusion.
