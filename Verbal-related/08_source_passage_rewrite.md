# AI Instruction Template: Rewrite Academic Passage into GMAT-Style Article

## Instruction
Rewrite the provided academic passage into a 250–400 word GMAT-style article suitable for educated non-specialist readers (e.g., science-interested high school or university students). Apply the following simplification strategies:

1. **Lexical (word-level) simplification**:
   - Replace academic or technical terms with common equivalents where possible.
   - Remove or generalize overly specific numerical or temporal references.
   - Avoid jargon unless essential and explained.
2. **Syntactic (sentence-level) simplification**:
   - Break down long or embedded sentences into short, clear statements.
   - Convert passive voice to active voice where it improves clarity.
   - Remove non-essential modifiers and subordinate clauses.
3. **Structural (discourse-level) simplification**:
   - Restructure the flow into a clear, linear narrative.
   - Merge or compress paragraphs with similar topics.
   - Remove complex theoretical framing or scholarly conclusions unless rewritten plainly.

Ensure the article:
- Retains the key hypothesis, findings, and implications of the original text.
- Is logically coherent, informative, and engaging.
- Maintains a length of 250–400 words.
- Uses clear transitions and accessible language for general science communication.
- Avoids direct quotations or citations from the original.

## Function
Transform complex academic passages into clear, concise GMAT-style articles to enhance reading comprehension, build reading stamina, and improve understanding of logical structures in texts.

## Suitable For
- Candidates preparing for GMAT reading comprehension sections.
- Individuals needing to strengthen reading skills for dense, informational texts.
- Readers with limited reading proficiency seeking accessible science content.
- Students interested in science who want engaging, simplified articles.

## Example
**Input:**

```
(prompt above omitted)
... Please rewrite the following input article based on these requirements: 

While many people think of genetic manipulation of food crops as being aimed at developing larger and larger plant varieties, some plant breeders have in fact concentrated on discovering or producing dwarf varieties, which are roughly half as tall as normal varieties.
```


**Output:**

### Rewritten English Version (Abstract & Complex Style)

It is commonly presupposed that the principal trajectory of genetic intervention in agronomic species entails an emphasis on the enhancement of phenotypic magnitude, particularly with reference to maximizing the vertical development of food crops. However, such an assumption fails to acknowledge the existence of an alternative vector within plant breeding practices that, either by strategic intent or empirical derivation, has centered upon the identification and cultivation of so-called dwarf phenotypes—those which exhibit a stature approximately reduced by half in comparison to conventional varietals.

This alternative emphasis presupposes the possibility that, contrary to prevalent expectations, the reduction in plant height may yield agronomic advantages whose recognition is contingent upon a reevaluation of conventional desirability metrics. Consequently, the assertion that genetic manipulation is unidirectionally focused on enlarging physical traits overlooks the documented pursuit, by some breeders, of compact varietal forms that challenge prevailing teleological assumptions regarding agricultural productivity.


### Simplified Chinese Translation (Clear and Easy Version)

很多人以為，基因改造作物的主要目的是讓植物長得更高、更大，但這種想法忽略了一些植物育種專家其實專注於培育「矮化品種」的事實。這些矮化品種的高度大約只有普通品種的一半。

這種不同的方向，說明比起讓作物變大，讓作物變矮有時也有它的好處。也因此，認為基因改造只是讓植物變大的說法，沒有注意到有些人其實在努力讓植物變小，以滿足其他農業需求。
