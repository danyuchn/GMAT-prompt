```
Industry's environmental improvement efforts have traditionally focused on pollution control through identifying, processing, and disposing of discharges or waste. Recently, more progressive companies have embraced the concept of pollution prevention, using such methods as material substitution and closed-loop processes to prevent pollution. Regardless of their approach to dealing with pollution, however, many companies view pollution treatment or control as too expensive. But companies must learn to view environmental improvement in terms of efficient use of resources and to recognize that pollution has “opportunity costs”—wasted resources, wasted effort, and diminished product value for customers.

This view of pollution as resulting from inefficient use of resources evokes the history of the “quality revolution” of the 1980s. Before that revolution, many managers believed that improving product quality was prohibitively expensive because it could be achieved only through additional inspections and reworking of “inevitable” product defects. What lay behind the old view was the assumption that both product design and production processes were unalterable. As a result of the quality revolution, companies now view defects as a sign of inefficient product and process design, not as an inevitable by-product of manufacturing.

Like product defects, industrial pollution often reveals flaws in product design or production processes. Companies can eliminate pollution and follow the basic principles of the quality revolution by using materials more efficiently, by obviating the need for hazardous and hard-to-handle materials, and by eliminating unneeded activities.

1. The term “opportunity costs” as it is used in the passage refers to which of the following?

(A) Costs to the consumer of new product development
(B) Financial ramifications of keeping pollution control costs low
(C) Opportunities to stop pollution before it begins
(D) Possibilities lost because of pollution
(E) Costs to industries of preventing pollution
